  "overview": "Build a production-ready web TOOL called \"Authenticity In Ai Content Creation\".\n\nProduct derived from radar signal: Authenticity in AI Content Creation. Source: agent.\n\n## Product Spec (FOLLOW THIS EXACTLY)\nProblem: Content creators need to turn rough ideas into polished drafts quickly\nCore Loop: User provides a topic and key points → App generates structured content → User gets an editable draft\nUser Input: A form with topic field, key points textarea, and tone/style selector\nTransformation: Use AI to expand the inputs into a well-structured article draft\nOutput: A formatted article preview with sections, plus copy-to-clipboard and markdown download\n\n\n## Architecture Requirements\n1. MUST have a form/input on the main page where the user provides data\n2. MUST have at least one API route (src/app/api/) that processes the input\n3. MUST display results that change based on user input\n4. MUST have a way to copy/download/export the output\n5. MUST NOT have hardcoded data arrays with 5+ items displayed in grids — if you're tempted to create a catalog, STOP and build a tool instead\n\n## What NOT to Build\n- Static dashboards with fake metrics\n- Technology catalogs with hardcoded entries\n- Comparison grids with pre-filled data\n- Landing pages without working tools\n\n## Tech Stack (already configured)\nNext.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS. Add npm packages as needed.\nFor AI features: use Anthropic SDK with process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\n\nAfter implementation, `npm run build` must succeed with zero errors.",
